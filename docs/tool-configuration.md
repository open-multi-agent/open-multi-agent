# Tool Configuration

Agents can be configured with fine-grained tool access control using presets, allowlists, and denylists.

## Declared governance roles in `runTeam()`

Tool and credential boundaries are often tied to named agents. When a goal must actually pass through specific roster roles, declare the topology structurally on the `runTeam()` call:

```typescript
const result = await orchestrator.runTeam(team, 'Review this change before release.', {
  governanceIntent: 'required',
  requiredRoles: ['reviewer', 'security'],
  requiredOrder: ['reviewer', 'security'],
})

if (result.governanceConclusion !== 'satisfied') {
  throw new Error('Required governance was not satisfied by the executed topology.')
}
```

For both `required` and `preferred`, OMA skips coordinator decomposition and the simple-goal single-agent short circuit. It creates one task for every `requiredRoles` entry, keeps each task assigned to that roster agent, and uses `requiredOrder` to create dependency edges. Each task receives the original goal unchanged; the agent's `systemPrompt`, tools, and credentials define the role. Downstream tasks receive prerequisite outputs through dependency-scoped memory.

The goal text is not inspected to choose this topology. The same declaration therefore produces the same roles and dependency order for English, Chinese, or any other language. Every `requiredRoles` name must exist in the team roster, and `requiredOrder`, when present, must be a permutation of those roles. Invalid declarations throw before any agent runs.

Use `governanceIntent: 'none'` to opt into the existing automatic `runTeam()` route explicitly. Omitting `governanceIntent` also preserves the existing behavior, including simple-goal short circuit and coordinator-generated task planning.

After execution, required declarations are checked against the execution
receipt. The `governanceConclusion` value is `satisfied`, `unsatisfied`, or
`not-applicable`. `required` is the only enforced intent;
`preferred`, `none`, and an omitted intent return `not-applicable`. An
`unsatisfied` conclusion means that a required role, dependency path/order, or
independent review fact was not observed. It does not rewrite `result.success`,
which keeps its existing runtime-error meaning, so governance-sensitive callers
must check `governanceConclusion` explicitly.

The gate reads only the structured execution topology produced by
`buildExecutionReceipt()`. Agent answer text cannot prove that another role ran
or that an independent review occurred, even if it contains reviewer names,
approval labels, or audit markers.

### Explicit modes and budget conflicts

`runTeam()` resolves execution policy in this order:

1. An application `mode` (`single` or `team`).
2. A declared `governanceIntent: 'required'` topology.
3. The existing automatic route, including the simple-goal Single short circuit.

`single` always uses the existing best-agent path. `team` forces the
coordinator-generated team path and bypasses the simple-goal short circuit.
`runAgent()` and `runTasks()` remain explicit choices in their own right.
Selecting `mode` declares a topology preference, not governance intent, so it
does not bypass consequential confirmation when `governanceIntent` is omitted.

An application may select a mode that overrides a required floor, but that
decision is never reported as a clean governance success:

```typescript
const result = await orchestrator.runTeam(team, goal, {
  mode: 'single',
  governanceIntent: 'required',
  requiredRoles: ['reviewer', 'security'],
  requiredOrder: ['reviewer', 'security'],
})

// The Single result is still returned, and runtime success keeps its existing meaning.
result.governanceConclusion // 'unsatisfied'
result.governanceReason     // 'overridden'
result.flags                // includes 'governance-overridden'
```

This is the "floor may be explicitly overridden, but never silently" rule.
The structured declaration is still validated before execution, even when an
explicit mode displaces its topology.

Token and cost ceilings can be set on the orchestrator or on one `runTeam()` /
`runTasks()` call. A per-run value cannot widen the orchestrator ceiling; the
lower value wins. This lets an application declare the governance floor and
budget ceiling together without introducing another budget subsystem:

```typescript
const result = await orchestrator.runTeam(team, goal, {
  governanceIntent: 'required',
  requiredRoles: ['reviewer', 'security'],
  requiredOrder: ['reviewer', 'security'],
  maxTokenBudget: 12_000,
  maxCostBudget: 0.25, // requires orchestrator estimateCost
})
```

If a required run exhausts that ceiling before every required role/order fact
is observed, the existing budget stop remains in force and the result reports
`governanceConclusion: 'unsatisfied'` with `governanceReason: 'budget'`.
`result.success` is not repurposed as a governance field; budget exhaustion
continues to use the existing `budget_exhausted` runtime status.

For a soft preference, the application can predeclare that a ceiling should
win without turning the missed review into a governance violation:

```typescript
const result = await orchestrator.runTeam(team, goal, {
  governanceIntent: 'preferred',
  requiredRoles: ['reviewer', 'security'],
  preferredUnderBudget: 'degrade',
  maxTokenBudget: 4_000,
})

// Executes the Single path and discloses why independent review was skipped.
result.governanceConclusion // 'not-applicable'
result.flags                // includes 'review-skipped-due-to-budget'
```

`preferredUnderBudget` defaults to `attempt`, which preserves the pre-existing
preferred-role behavior. `degrade` applies only when an effective token or cost
ceiling exists and no explicit `mode` already won. It is an application policy,
not a model-cost prediction: OMA intentionally does not estimate whether a plan
will fit before it runs. Normal ceiling enforcement remains reactive at model
turn and task boundaries.

## Consequential tools on undeclared runs

Tool authors can declare that granting a tool permits real side effects:

```typescript
const rotateSecret = defineTool({
  name: 'rotate_secret',
  description: 'Rotate an application secret.',
  inputSchema: z.object({ service: z.string() }),
  consequential: true,
  execute: async ({ service }) => rotateServiceSecret(service),
})
```

`consequential` is optional and defaults to `false`. The built-in `bash`,
`file_write`, and `file_edit` tools are marked consequential; read-only
filesystem tools are not. Custom and MCP tools remain benign unless their
registered `ToolDefinition` explicitly opts in.

For `runAgent()` and an automatic `runTeam()` call that omits
`governanceIntent`, OMA checks the final grant set after preset, allowlist,
denylist, custom-tool, and default-preset resolution. If at least one granted
tool is consequential, the result carries the additive machine-readable flag:

```typescript
if (result.flags?.includes('consequential-no-independence')) {
  // The run had consequential capability without a governance declaration.
}

const receipt = buildExecutionReceipt(result)
// The same flag is copied to receipt.flags.
```

This classification uses **tool grants only**. OMA never scans the goal,
prompt, model output, tool arguments, or words such as `password`, `refund`,
`security`, or `production` to infer consequences. A goal containing those
words but exposing only benign tools is not flagged. Conversely, a granted
consequential tool is flagged even when the goal sounds harmless.

Declared `required`, `preferred`, and `none` `runTeam()` calls do not enter this
fallback. Neither do explicit `runTasks()` DAGs or `runFromPlan()` replays;
those calls already have application-supplied structure. The fallback never
changes the execution topology or upgrades a run to independent governance.

### Opt-in confirmation

Confirmation is off by default. Set `requireConsequentialConfirmation: true`
to guard consequential calls on the undeclared runs above:

```typescript
const orchestrator = new OpenMultiAgent({
  requireConsequentialConfirmation: true,
  onToolCall: async (context) => {
    if (context.consequential !== true) return { action: 'allow' }
    return (await app.confirm(context))
      ? { action: 'allow' }
      : { action: 'deny', reason: 'User rejected the action.' }
  },
})
```

The guard composes with the existing per-call `onToolCall` gateway, after input
validation and before `execute`. An `allow` continues; a `deny` does not call
the tool and returns a rejected run outcome. For a dynamically planned
`runTeam()`, an approved `onPlanReady` callback can supply the approval when no
per-call gate is configured. If neither approval path exists, the tool is not
executed and the result returns `confirmationRequired: true` with
`status.code === 'rejected'`. The application can then re-run with an
`onToolCall` decision, or reject the action. The
`consequential-no-independence` flag remains present whether confirmation is
disabled, approved, pending, or rejected.

## Built-in tools are opt-in (default-deny)

Built-in tools — `bash` and the filesystem tools (`file_read`, `file_write`, `file_edit`, `grep`, `glob`) — are **default-deny**. An agent receives a built-in tool only when it is granted explicitly via `tools` (an allowlist of names) or `toolPreset`. An agent that sets **neither** resolves to **zero** built-in tools:

```typescript
// No tools / toolPreset → this agent cannot run bash or touch the filesystem.
const llmOnly: AgentConfig = { name: 'writer', model: 'claude-sonnet-4-6' }

// Opt in explicitly.
const coder: AgentConfig = {
  name: 'coder',
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-6',
  tools: ['file_read', 'file_write', 'bash'],
}
```

This holds uniformly across `runAgent`, `runTeam` / `runTasks`, the `runTeam` simple-goal short-circuit, and a standalone `Agent`. Calling `registerBuiltInTools()` makes tools _available to grant_ — it does not grant them; the agent still needs `tools` / `toolPreset`. If the model emits a call to a registered-but-ungranted tool (a confused model, or text steered by prompt injection), the runner returns a clear `"not granted"` error instead of executing it.

**Two things stay true once a tool is granted — design around them:**

- **`bash` is not sandboxed.** Granting it gives the agent arbitrary shell on the host (see [_Filesystem Working Directory_](#filesystem-working-directory) below). Only the filesystem tools are path-contained.
- **Tool output flows to your model provider.** Every tool result is appended to the conversation and sent to the configured LLM on the next turn. Anything a tool reads — file contents, command output, fetched pages — leaves your process and reaches the provider. Grant read access deliberately.

**Custom / runtime tools are exempt from the grant requirement** — registering them _is_ the grant. Tools passed via `customTools` or `agent.addTool()` are always available (they still respect `disallowedTools`); see [_Custom Tools_](#custom-tools). **`delegate_to_agent`** (team orchestration handoff) follows the default-deny rule like any other built-in: grant it with `tools: ['delegate_to_agent']` on each agent you want to be able to delegate.

### Restoring the previous "all tools" behavior

Before default-deny, an agent with no tool config received every registered built-in — including the unsandboxed `bash`. To restore that convenience in one line, set `defaultToolPreset` on the orchestrator:

```typescript
const orchestrator = new OpenMultiAgent({
  defaultToolPreset: 'full', // agents with no tools/toolPreset get the full preset
})
```

`defaultToolPreset` is a **fallback**: it applies only to agents that declare neither `tools` nor `toolPreset`. Per-agent config always overrides it, and it never widens an agent that already declares a grant. It is not applied to the internal coordinator, the final-synthesis pass, or the consensus proposer / judge agents (`runConsensus` and the per-task `verify` hook), which run from their own configs; grant tools to those per agent.

## Tool Presets

Predefined tool sets for common use cases:

```typescript
const readonlyAgent: AgentConfig = {
  name: 'reader',
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-6',
  toolPreset: 'readonly',  // file_read, grep, glob
}

const readwriteAgent: AgentConfig = {
  name: 'editor',
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-6',
  toolPreset: 'readwrite',  // file_read, file_write, file_edit, grep, glob
}

const fullAgent: AgentConfig = {
  name: 'executor',
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-6',
  toolPreset: 'full',  // file_read, file_write, file_edit, grep, glob, bash
}
```

## Advanced Filtering

Combine presets with allowlists and denylists for precise control:

```typescript
const customAgent: AgentConfig = {
  name: 'custom',
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-6',
  toolPreset: 'readwrite',        // Start with: file_read, file_write, file_edit, grep, glob
  tools: ['file_read', 'grep'],   // Allowlist: intersect with preset = file_read, grep
  disallowedTools: ['grep'],      // Denylist: subtract = file_read only
}
```

**Resolution order:** default-deny (no preset _and_ no allowlist ⇒ zero built-in tools) → preset → allowlist → denylist → framework safety rails. Custom / runtime tools bypass the grant step (registration is the grant) but still honor the denylist.

## Per-call gating with `onToolCall`

The layers above answer **"which tools are reachable?"** by operating on tool _names_. The `onToolCall` gate answers a different question one layer down: **"should _this specific invocation_ run right now?"** `bash` is a single allowed name that covers `ls -la` and `rm -rf /` equally; the gate inspects the actual arguments and can veto individual calls.

The hook is **opt-in and off by default**. It runs once per tool invocation, after Zod input validation and before the tool implementation, and returns a decision:

```typescript
import type { ToolCallContext, ToolCallDecision } from '@open-multi-agent/core'

const orchestrator = new OpenMultiAgent({
  // Orchestrator-level default, inherited by any agent that sets no gate of its own.
  onToolCall: async (ctx: ToolCallContext): Promise<ToolCallDecision> => {
    // ctx: { toolName, input (post-validation), agentName, consequential?, runId?, taskId? }
    if (ctx.toolName !== 'bash') return { action: 'allow' }
    if (/^\s*rm\b/.test(String(ctx.input.command))) {
      return { action: 'deny', reason: 'rm is blocked' }
    }
    return { action: 'allow' }
  },
})
```

Key semantics:

- **`deny` returns a structured error `ToolResult`; it never throws.** The model sees the `reason` as a normal tool error and can adapt (try a safer command, ask the user, stop) rather than crashing the run. A gate that throws or returns an invalid decision is turned into an error result too (fail closed).
- **Human-in-the-loop lives inside your callback.** `await` your own CLI prompt, Slack button, or web dialog, then return `allow` or `deny`. The framework prescribes no review channel, keeping the surface small.
- **Agent overrides orchestrator.** `AgentConfig.onToolCall` beats `OrchestratorConfig.onToolCall` for that agent, so a team can set a default policy while one specialist tightens or relaxes it. A standalone `new Agent({ ..., onToolCall })` wires the gate straight into its executor.
- **Runs after the name-based grant.** Default-deny / allowlist / denylist resolution runs **first**; a tool that is not granted is refused before the gate is reached, so the gate only ever sees calls to already-reachable tools. Custom tools and MCP tools route through the same executor, so they are gated too.
- **Orthogonal to `onApproval`.** `OrchestratorConfig.onApproval` gates whole task batches between orchestration rounds; `onToolCall` gates a single tool invocation during execution. They operate at different layers and compose.
- **Observability.** When a gate runs, the `tool_call` trace event carries `gated: true`, `gateAction: 'allow' | 'deny'`, and (on deny) a `gateReason` that is redacted like other sensitive trace text, so `onTrace` consumers can audit every decision.

> **Not a security boundary.** A gate that returns `deny` still relies on cooperating code; it is a coordination layer, not containment. `bash` remains un-sandboxed (see the callout below). For an actually-untrusted shell, use process-level isolation (a container / VM / seccomp); the gate is for *policy*, not *isolation*.

### Shell risk classifier

Writing regex tables by hand is tedious, so an optional, dependency-free classifier ships behind a subpath export. It scores a bash command as `safe | review | high`; you decide what each level means:

```typescript
import { classifyBashCommand } from '@open-multi-agent/core/classifiers'

const orchestrator = new OpenMultiAgent({
  onToolCall: async (ctx) => {
    if (ctx.toolName !== 'bash') return { action: 'allow' }
    const risk = classifyBashCommand(String(ctx.input.command))
    if (risk.level === 'safe') return { action: 'allow' }
    if (risk.level === 'high') return { action: 'deny', reason: risk.reason }
    // 'review' → ask a human
    return (await myUi.confirm(ctx, risk)) ? { action: 'allow' } : { action: 'deny', reason: risk.reason }
  },
})
```

- **`safe`**: read-only inspection (`ls`, `cat`, `pwd`, `grep`/`rg` with a path, `git status|log|diff|show`, ...).
- **`review`**: context-heavy or ambiguous: `ls -R`, `find /` / `find ~` without `-maxdepth`, `grep -r` / `rg -r` without a scoped path, `tree`, `du`, and any unrecognised command (default: "don't run blind").
- **`high`**: destructive / sensitive: `rm`, `sudo`, `curl ... | bash`, `dd`, `mkfs`, `chmod 777`/`-R`, `git push --force`, `npm publish`, writes to system paths.

Compound commands are segmented on shell separators (`&&`, `||`, `;`, `|`, substitutions) and the **highest** risk found wins, so a safe prefix cannot smuggle a destructive suffix (`ls && rm -rf /` becomes `high`). Quoted spans are stripped first, so `echo "rm -rf /"` stays `safe`.

The classifier is a **shallow heuristic, not a parser**; it can be fooled by obfuscation (variable indirection, base64-decode-then-exec, exotic quoting). It is convenience only: extend the tables, wrap it, or replace it entirely. See [`examples/patterns/risk-gated-bash.ts`](../packages/core/examples/patterns/risk-gated-bash.ts) for an end-to-end demo.

## Filesystem Working Directory

Built-in filesystem tools (`file_read`, `file_write`, `file_edit`, `grep`, `glob`) are sandboxed to a per-agent working directory. Paths must be absolute and resolve inside that directory; symlinks are resolved before the check so they cannot escape the configured root.

> **`bash` is not sandboxed.** Once an agent has a shell, any `cd /etc`, absolute path, or subshell trivially escapes a per-tool path check. The sandbox is therefore best understood as **path containment for built-in filesystem tools**, not a security boundary against arbitrary command execution. If full path containment matters, drop `bash` via `disallowedTools: ['bash']` (or omit it from your `tools` allowlist) and rely on the filesystem tools. Process-level isolation (containers, seatbelt, firejail) is the right tool for an actually-untrusted shell.

### Three typical configurations

```typescript
import { OpenMultiAgent } from '@open-multi-agent/core'

// 1. Default — sandbox rooted at `<cwd>/.agent-workspace`.
//    The directory is auto-created on first write. Agents cannot read or
//    write outside that subdirectory, which keeps source files, `.env`,
//    `.git/`, and `node_modules` off-limits even when the host launched
//    from the repo root.
const defaultOrchestrator = new OpenMultiAgent()

// 2. Widen the sandbox to the entire current working directory.
//    Useful when the agent is a coding assistant operating on the user's
//    project (the host already established trust by launching there).
const wideOrchestrator = new OpenMultiAgent({
  defaultCwd: process.cwd(),
})

// 3. Disable the sandbox entirely (relative and absolute paths anywhere).
const unrestrictedOrchestrator = new OpenMultiAgent({
  defaultCwd: null,
})
```

### Custom sandbox root

```typescript
const orchestrator = new OpenMultiAgent({
  defaultCwd: '/var/run/my-agent-workspace', // any absolute path
})

const agent: AgentConfig = {
  name: 'editor',
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-6',
  toolPreset: 'readwrite',
  cwd: '/var/run/my-agent-workspace/packages/app', // optional per-agent override
}
```

**Resolution order.** `AgentConfig.cwd` (if set) → `OrchestratorConfig.defaultCwd` (if set) → `<process.cwd()>/.agent-workspace`. Pass `null` at either level to disable the sandbox for that scope.

**Auto-creation.** The sandbox root is `mkdir -p`'d on first write, so callers do not need to pre-create `.agent-workspace` (or any custom path).

The `bash` tool runs in its own process group on POSIX, so timeouts and abort signals kill any backgrounded children rather than letting them outlive the parent.

## Custom Tools

Two ways to give an agent a tool that is not in the built-in set.

**Inject at config time** via `customTools` on `AgentConfig`. Good when the orchestrator wires up tools centrally. Tools defined here bypass preset/allowlist filtering but still respect `disallowedTools`.

```typescript
import { defineTool } from '@open-multi-agent/core'
import { z } from 'zod'

const weatherTool = defineTool({
  name: 'get_weather',
  description: 'Look up current weather for a city.',
  inputSchema: z.object({ city: z.string() }),
  execute: async ({ city }) => ({ data: await fetchWeather(city) }),
})

const agent: AgentConfig = {
  name: 'assistant',
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-6',
  customTools: [weatherTool],
}
```

**Register at runtime** via `agent.addTool(tool)`. Tools added this way are always available, regardless of filtering.

## Per-agent tool credentials

A tool's `execute` closure often captures a secret — an API token, a service key. If several agents share that tool, they all wield the same secret at full scope: a compromised or misbehaving subagent inherits every credential the coordinator holds. To scope secrets per agent, set a `credentials` bag on `AgentConfig` and read it from `ToolUseContext` inside the tool, instead of closing over a module-level secret.

```typescript
const search = defineTool({
  name: 'web_search',
  description: 'Search the web.',
  inputSchema: z.object({ query: z.string() }),
  // Reads the calling agent's scoped key, not a shared module secret.
  execute: async ({ query }, ctx) => ({
    data: await callSearchApi(query, ctx.credentials?.SEARCH_API_KEY),
  }),
})

const team = {
  name: 'research',
  agents: [
    {
      name: 'researcher',
      model: 'claude-sonnet-4-6',
      customTools: [search],
      credentials: { SEARCH_API_KEY: process.env.RESEARCHER_SEARCH_KEY! },
    },
    {
      name: 'publisher',
      model: 'claude-sonnet-4-6',
      customTools: [cms], // a CMS tool defined like `search` above
      credentials: { CMS_TOKEN: process.env.PUBLISHER_CMS_TOKEN! },
    },
  ],
}
```

The bag is **per agent and never merged**: `researcher` sees only `SEARCH_API_KEY`, `publisher` sees only `CMS_TOKEN`, and neither the coordinator nor a delegated subagent inherits another agent's bag. An agent with no `credentials` set gets `ctx.credentials === undefined`.

This is a **scoping convenience, not an isolation boundary**. Tool code runs in-process and can still read `process.env` or any module-level variable; `credentials` just gives you a first-class place to hand each agent only the secrets it needs. (You can already approximate this by giving each agent its own `customTools` instance with a scoped closure — the `credentials` bag makes it explicit and keeps the secret out of the closure.) Values are treated as secrets: the `credentials` key is auto-redacted from traces and dashboards.

## Tool Output Control

Long tool outputs can blow up conversation size and cost. Two controls work together.

**Validation (optional).** Add `outputSchema` to catch malformed tool results before they are forwarded:

> **Note — two different `outputSchema` fields.** The one on `defineTool()` /
> `ToolDefinition` (shown below) validates a single **tool's** `ToolResult.data`
> — it is always a `ZodSchema<string>` because tool output is serialised as
> text. The `outputSchema` on [`AgentConfig`](../packages/core/examples/patterns/structured-output.ts)
> is different: it validates the **agent's final answer** as parsed JSON
> against an arbitrary Zod schema (see _Structured output_ in `packages/core/examples/`).
> Different types, different scopes — TypeScript won't warn you if you mix
> them up, so pick the one that matches the layer you're working at.

```typescript
const jsonTool = defineTool({
  name: 'json_tool',
  description: 'Return JSON payload as string.',
  inputSchema: z.object({}),
  outputSchema: z.string().refine((value) => {
    try {
      JSON.parse(value)
      return true
    } catch {
      return false
    }
  }, 'Output must be valid JSON'),
  execute: async () => ({ data: '{"ok": true}' }),
})
```

**Truncation.** Cap an individual tool result to a head + tail excerpt with a marker in between:

```typescript
const agent: AgentConfig = {
  // ...
  maxToolOutputChars: 10_000, // applies to every tool this agent runs
}

// Per-tool override (takes priority over AgentConfig.maxToolOutputChars):
const bigQueryTool = defineTool({
  // ...
  maxOutputChars: 50_000,
})
```

**Post-consumption compression.** Once the agent has acted on a tool result, compress older copies in the transcript so they stop costing input tokens on every subsequent turn. Error results are never compressed.

```typescript
const agent: AgentConfig = {
  // ...
  compressToolResults: true,                 // default threshold: 500 chars
  // or: compressToolResults: { minChars: 2_000 }
}
```

## MCP Tools (Model Context Protocol)

`open-multi-agent` can connect to stdio MCP servers and expose their tools directly to agents.

```typescript
import { connectMCPTools } from '@open-multi-agent/core/mcp'

const { tools, disconnect } = await connectMCPTools({
  command: 'npx',
  args: ['--no-install', '@modelcontextprotocol/server-github'],
  env: {
    GITHUB_TOKEN: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN,
    HOME: process.env.HOME,
    PATH: process.env.PATH,
  },
  namePrefix: 'github',
})

// Register each MCP tool in your ToolRegistry, then include their names in AgentConfig.tools
// Don't forget cleanup when done
await disconnect()
```

Notes:
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` is an optional peer dependency, only needed when using MCP.
- Current transport support is stdio.
- MCP input validation is delegated to the MCP server (`inputSchema` is `z.any()`).
- Prefer locally installed or pinned MCP server binaries and pass only the environment variables that server needs. Avoid spreading `process.env` into MCP subprocesses.

See [`integrations/mcp-github`](../packages/core/examples/integrations/mcp-github.ts) for a full runnable setup.
