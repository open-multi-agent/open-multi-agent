# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Open Multi-Agent! This guide covers the basics to get you started.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-multi-agent/open-multi-agent.git
cd open-multi-agent
npm install
```

Requires Node.js >= 18.

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run build          # Compile every workspace
npm run dev            # Watch-mode compilation for @open-multi-agent/core
npm run lint           # Type-check every workspace (tsc --noEmit)
npm test               # Run unit tests in every workspace
npm run test:watch     # Core Vitest watch mode
npm run test:coverage  # Core unit tests with coverage
npm run test:scaffold  # End-to-end create-oma-app scaffold smoke test
```

## Running Tests

Unit tests live in `packages/core/tests/` and `packages/create-oma-app/tests/`. They run without API keys or network access — provider SDKs and external processes are mocked where needed.

```bash
npm test
```

Core E2E tests are separate because they require `RUN_E2E=1` and real provider credentials:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

Run checks that match the surface you changed and record the commands and results in the PR description. For code changes, start with `npm run lint && npm test`; also run `npm run build` when package output or public entry points may be affected, and `npm run test:scaffold` when changing `create-oma-app` scaffolding or templates.

CI is the source of truth for the full pre-merge matrix. It runs lint, unit tests on Node 18/20/22, coverage, workspace builds, package/import smoke tests, template type-checking, tarball assertions, and the scaffold E2E test.

## Making a Pull Request

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Add or update tests and user-facing documentation when behavior changes
4. Run the checks relevant to your change and note any skipped checks with a reason
5. Open a PR against `main`

### PR Checklist

- [ ] Tests cover changed behavior, or the PR explains why tests are not needed
- [ ] User-facing documentation and examples are updated, or marked not applicable
- [ ] Compatibility, breaking changes, and migration requirements are documented, or marked not applicable
- [ ] Dependency changes are justified and follow the package-specific rules below
- [ ] The PR links a relevant issue when one exists

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode, ES modules (`.js` extensions in imports)
- No additional linter/formatter configured — follow existing patterns
- Keep dependencies minimal. Core has three direct runtime dependencies: `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `openai`, and `zod`
- Add provider SDKs to core as optional peer dependencies and load them lazily with dynamic `import()`
- Justify dependency changes to other workspaces in the PR description

## Architecture Overview

See the [README](../packages/core/README.md#architecture) for an architecture diagram. Key entry points:

- **Orchestrator**: `packages/core/src/orchestrator/orchestrator.ts` — top-level API
- **Task system**: `packages/core/src/task/queue.ts`, `packages/core/src/task/task.ts` — dependency DAG
- **Agent**: `packages/core/src/agent/runner.ts` — conversation loop
- **Tools**: `packages/core/src/tool/framework.ts`, `packages/core/src/tool/executor.ts` — tool registry and execution
- **LLM adapters**: `packages/core/src/llm/` — built-in providers + OpenAI-compatible + AI SDK bridge (see [docs/providers.md](../docs/providers.md))
- **Observability**: `packages/core/src/observability/` — trace records, sinks, exporters, and stores
- **App scaffolder**: `packages/create-oma-app/src/` and `packages/create-oma-app/templates/` — CLI and starter templates

## Where to Contribute

Check the [issues](https://github.com/open-multi-agent/open-multi-agent/issues) page. Issues labeled `good first issue` are scoped and approachable. Issues labeled `help wanted` are larger but well-defined.
