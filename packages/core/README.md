`@open-multi-agent/core` is the OMA orchestration runtime for TypeScript backends. Give it one agent, an explicit task graph, or a **dynamic workflow** that the coordinator generates from a goal at runtime.

The runtime schedules dependencies, runs independent work in parallel, shares context across agents, and returns an inspectable result. For product positioning and known users, see the [project overview](https://github.com/open-multi-agent/open-multi-agent#readme).

## Quick Start

Requires Node.js 18 or newer. Scaffold and run a starter in one command:

```bash
npm create oma-app@latest my-oma
```

In an interactive terminal, the scaffolder selects a starter and Cloud/Ollama runtime, installs dependencies, then runs a deterministic demo and produces an offline dashboard. The demo uses scripted model responses, needs no API key, and makes no model request; OMA orchestration still runs locally for real. Pass `--no-install` to generate files only, or `--no-run` to install without starting the demo.

To add OMA to an existing backend:

```bash
npm install @open-multi-agent/core
```

*Migrating from `@jackchen_me/open-multi-agent`? That package is deprecated; install `@open-multi-agent/core` instead.*

```typescript
import { OpenMultiAgent, type AgentConfig } from '@open-multi-agent/core'

const model = process.env.OMA_MODEL ?? 'gpt-5.4'

const agents: AgentConfig[] = [
  { name: 'researcher', model, systemPrompt: 'Find the relevant facts.' },
  { name: 'analyst', model, systemPrompt: 'Compare evidence and identify tradeoffs.' },
]

const orchestrator = new OpenMultiAgent({
  defaultProvider: 'openai',
  defaultModel: model,
})

const team = orchestrator.createTeam('research-team', {
  name: 'research-team',
  agents,
  sharedMemory: true,
})

const result = await orchestrator.runTeam(team, 'Compare three approaches and recommend one.')
console.log(result.agentResults.get('coordinator')?.output)
```

Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` for this example. For other hosted or local models, see [Providers](#providers).

## Execution Modes

| Mode | Method | When to use | Example |
|------|--------|-------------|---------|
| Single agent | `runAgent()` | One agent, one prompt | [`basics/single-agent`](examples/basics/single-agent.ts) |
| Auto-orchestrated team | `runTeam()` | Give a goal, let the coordinator plan and execute | [`basics/team-collaboration`](examples/basics/team-collaboration.ts) |
| Explicit pipeline | `runTasks()` | You define the task graph and assignments | [`basics/task-pipeline`](examples/basics/task-pipeline.ts) |

Use `planOnly` to inspect a generated task graph before execution, then `createPlanArtifact()` and `runFromPlan()` to replay it. `runConsensus()` adds a proposer→judge verification loop when one answer needs extra scrutiny.

Automatic `runTeam()` topology is pluggable through `executionRouter` on `OpenMultiAgent` or one `runTeam()` call. The built-in `DeterministicRouter` uses language-neutral structure and script-aware length, with an empty-roster qualification for the Single path; custom routers receive a prompt-free roster summary and fall back safely when they fail. Explicit `mode` and declared governance always take precedence, and auto results expose `routingDecision`. See [Execution Routing](https://github.com/open-multi-agent/open-multi-agent/blob/main/docs/execution-routing.md). Execution Routing selects Single versus Team; [Model Routing](https://github.com/open-multi-agent/open-multi-agent/blob/main/docs/model-routing.md) selects models inside that topology.

When an application must enforce named independent roles, declare that governance intent instead of relying on wording in the goal:

```typescript
const governed = await orchestrator.runTeam(team, 'Review the evidence and assess the risk.', {
  governanceIntent: 'required',
  requiredRoles: ['researcher', 'analyst'],
  requiredOrder: ['researcher', 'analyst'],
})
```

`required` and `preferred` both bypass automatic decomposition and the simple-goal short circuit. OMA creates one task per declared roster name, assigns it to that agent, and chains tasks in `requiredOrder`; dependency outputs are passed to downstream roles. The topology comes only from these structured fields, so equivalent goals in different languages use the same roles and order. `none` or an omitted `governanceIntent` preserves the existing automatic `runTeam()` behavior.

## Scheduling

Set `schedulingStrategy` on `OpenMultiAgent` to choose how unassigned tasks are
mapped to agents. The setting applies to coordinator-generated `runTeam()`
plans and explicit or restored task queues. Tasks with an explicit `assignee`
keep that assignment.

```typescript
const orchestrator = new OpenMultiAgent({
  schedulingStrategy: 'capability-match',
})
```

| Strategy | Assignment behavior | Recommended when |
|----------|---------------------|------------------|
| `dependency-first` (default) | Assigns tasks that unblock the most downstream work first, rotating agents | The task graph has meaningful dependencies |
| `round-robin` | Distributes tasks in queue order across the roster | Agents are interchangeable |
| `least-busy` | Chooses the agent with the fewest active or newly assigned tasks | Task duration varies and load balance matters |
| `capability-match` | Matches task text against agent names and system prompts | Agents have distinct, clearly described roles |

These strategies select one scheduling dimension at a time; they are not
combined or weighted.

## Capabilities

| Capability | What you get |
|------------|--------------|
| **Dynamic orchestration** | Runtime goal decomposition, dependency-aware scheduling, parallel branches, configurable assignment, opt-in team context for workers (`revealCoordinator`), and final synthesis. |
| **Models and reasoning** | Mix built-in, OpenAI-compatible, AI SDK, or local models; map one `thinking` config to each provider's reasoning setting, route phases separately, and preserve reasoning only when explicitly enabled. |
| **Tools and handoffs** | Built-in tools are default-deny; custom tools, MCP, and guarded `delegate_to_agent` handoffs are opt-in. |
| **Controlled outputs** | Stream per agent, validate results with Zod, approve plans or task rounds, rewrite prompts or post-process results with `beforeRun` / `afterRun`, and cancel with `AbortSignal`. |
| **Evaluation** | Version EvalSets, run reference scorers, gate CI with offline reports, persist results, or sample production runs on a best-effort path. |
| **Memory and recovery** | Shared memory is pluggable; checkpoints resume interrupted runs without repeating completed tasks. |
| **Observability** | Stable run identity, traces, redaction, TraceStore, and the offline DAG/Waterfall Viewer are available without a hosted service. |
| **External agents** | ACP and process backends let coding CLIs participate while OMA keeps scheduling, memory, and budgets. |

## Architecture

```text
goal or explicit tasks
         |
         v
Coordinator -> Task DAG -> Scheduler -> AgentPool
                    |                       |-- LLM adapters
                    |                       `-- tools / external backends
                    |
                    |-- SharedMemory / checkpoints
                    `-- TraceRecord -> TraceStore / Run Viewer / OTel
```

The coordinator plans once; the scheduler owns execution order. Agents share results through memory, while checkpoints and traces form separate recovery and observability paths. Detailed contracts live in the linked subsystem guides below.

## Examples

Start with one example that matches the behavior you need:

| Goal | Example |
|---|---|
| See coordinator planning | [`basics/team-collaboration`](examples/basics/team-collaboration.ts) |
| Build an explicit DAG | [`cookbook/contract-review-dag`](examples/cookbook/contract-review-dag.ts) |
| Validate structured output | [`patterns/structured-output`](examples/patterns/structured-output.ts) |
| Delegate between agents | [`patterns/agent-handoff`](examples/patterns/agent-handoff.ts) |
| Replay a frozen plan | [`patterns/plan-replay`](examples/patterns/plan-replay.ts) |
| Embed OMA in a backend | [`integrations/express-customer-support`](examples/integrations/express-customer-support/) |
| Export an offline trace viewer | [`integrations/observability-v2/run-viewer`](examples/integrations/observability-v2/run-viewer.ts) |

The [example index](examples/README.md) covers all basics, cookbook workflows, patterns, providers, and integrations.

## Providers

Change `provider`, `model`, and credentials; the agent shape stays the same.

| Route | Use |
|---|---|
| Built in | Anthropic, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Copilot, Grok, DeepSeek, Doubao, Hunyuan, MiniMax, MiMo, Qiniu |
| Optional peers | Gemini (`@google/genai`) and Bedrock (`@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime`) |
| OpenAI-compatible | Set `provider: 'openai'` + `baseURL` for Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio, OpenRouter, Groq, Mistral, Kimi, Qwen, or Zhipu |
| AI SDK | Use `AISdkAdapter` with `ai` and your selected `@ai-sdk/*` provider (AI SDK 7 needs Node.js 22+) |

Optional integrations load only when used: core directly installs only `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `openai`, and `zod`; other SDKs are lazy-loading opt-in peers, and OpenTelemetry lives entirely in `@open-multi-agent/otel`. Dependency changes are weighed on demonstrated value plus security, size, maintenance, and compatibility cost, not a fixed count.

See [Providers](https://github.com/open-multi-agent/open-multi-agent/blob/main/docs/providers.md) and [Tool configuration](https://github.com/open-multi-agent/open-multi-agent/blob/main/docs/tool-configuration.md) for credentials, models, the AI SDK bridge, reasoning settings, MCP, and local endpoints.

## Production

| Goal | Configure |
|---|---|
| Bound work | `maxTurns`, `timeoutMs`, `callTimeoutMs`, `contextStrategy`, `loopDetection` |
| Control spend | `maxTokenBudget`; `maxCostBudget` + application-owned `estimateCost` |
| Limit tools | `tools` / `toolPreset`, `cwd` / `defaultCwd`, tool-output caps |
| Recover | Task retries, checkpointing, and `restore()` |
| Review work | `planOnly`, `onPlanReady`, and approval callbacks |
| Observe | Trace sinks, TraceStore, Run Viewer, or the optional OTel adapter |

Budget checks run at turn and task boundaries, so a run can overshoot by up to one model turn; they are not a cent-exact stop. `estimateCost` receives each call's token usage plus the agent, effective `model`, `provider`, phase, and `taskId`, and your application owns the price table.

Built-in tools are default-deny, and every tool result is sent to your model provider, so grant read and exec access deliberately. Filesystem tools stay within the configured `cwd`; granted `bash` is not sandboxed. Secrets are redacted from traces, shell output, and Viewer payloads by default.

### Observability

Core already provides run identity, trace sinks, queryable in-memory/file stores, and an offline Run Viewer. These cover local debugging, audit artifacts, and post-run analysis without OpenTelemetry.

[`@open-multi-agent/otel`](https://github.com/open-multi-agent/open-multi-agent/blob/main/packages/otel/README.md) is an **optional enterprise integration** for teams that already operate a centralized OpenTelemetry stack. It converts OMA traces into standard OTel spans so multi-agent runs can join company-wide monitoring, alerting, and incident workflows. The application owns the provider and its lifecycle; telemetry failures never change the run result.

See the [observability guide](https://github.com/open-multi-agent/open-multi-agent/blob/main/docs/observability.md), [migration guide](https://github.com/open-multi-agent/open-multi-agent/blob/main/docs/observability-migration.md), and [performance guidance](https://github.com/open-multi-agent/open-multi-agent/blob/main/docs/observability-performance.md).
